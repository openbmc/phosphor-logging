      "message": "I\u0027m not sure what output exactly you have in mind. With this patch journald gets the message with many fields but journalctl has many different kinds of outputs to represent the log entries. Then rsyslog also gets full information from journald and the end user can do filtering, transformations and redirections with RainerScript.\nHere\u0027s a sample of what rsyslog saves to a file using all defaults:\n```\n2024-03-05T18:09:18.647251+00:00 g2 phosphor-log-manager[267]: Test message arg1\u003d1value1 arg2\u003dvalue2\n```\nproduced by a manual D-Bus call:\n```\n# busctl call xyz.openbmc_project.Logging /xyz/openbmc_project/logging xyz.openbmc_project.Logging.Create Create \u0027ssa{ss}\u0027 \"Test message\" xyz.openbmc_project.Logging.Entry.Level.Error 2 arg1 1value1 arg2 value2\n```\nWould that be enough of an example? Or do you want something from `phosphor-sel-logger` specifically?",

      "message": "phosphor-sel-logger isn\u0027t using lg2 or other phosphor-logging features because of https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/phosphor-sel-logger/+/62687 . In the current patch we are discussing I could have used something like `lg2::log\u003cisev\u003e(syslog_msg)` I guess if it\u0027s guaranteed to never create a D-Bus entry on its own.\n\nAnd talking about never, I clearly have no idea about the anticipated future of this code. What is the plan with the logging exactly? Will some machinery be added to support multiple hosts SELs? Will that patch to phosphor-sel-logger be eventually reverted? Will phosphor-logging gain full independence from rsyslog for all the available Redfish features?",
