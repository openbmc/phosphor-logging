      "message": "we can hold up to 3000 PELs, so when deleting all won\u0027t this make 3000 D-Bus calls?  \nThat sounds horribly slow for something that should be fast.  Or, to prove it isn\u0027t, can you create 3000 PELs and then get timings of doing a delete all with and without this code?\n\n I was thinking it would do something like maintain a cache of the hwIsolation\u0027s D-Bus model by watching signals so it wouldn\u0027t have to make any calls at all.",
