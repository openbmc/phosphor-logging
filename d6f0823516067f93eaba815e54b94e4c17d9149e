      "message": "Yes, this is one thing I didn\u0027t like with the way this ended up due to the way meson compiles dependencies.  I might be able to create an additional static library to try to reduce the number of independent parts being built into each test case.  Also, in the original autotools, test cases expressed their dependent non-test sources in a *very* fine-grained manner.  I could go back to that (and add them all to the sources keyword here in this dictionary) but it also seemed like it was a whole lot of redundancy.\n\nSounds like this is a concern so I can spend a bit of time trying to reduce how many artifacts are pulled into each test case (or at least independently compiled ones).  I might do that as a separate commit.",
