      "message": "I think since there is no need for these when the registry is used to create a PEL, and because there can be a lot of large notes sections, it would be good to put #ifdef PELTOOL flags around the documentation section, assuming I\u0027m not missing something.  That also means registry.cpp needs to be moved out of libpel in the meson.build and put in the separate sections so it will get the PELTOOL set when building peltool.",
