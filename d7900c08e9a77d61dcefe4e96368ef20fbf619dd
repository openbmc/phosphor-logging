      "message": "Yeah, I tried all the options we discussed on discord and none of them seemed like an appropriate solution. The CLI application is not even aware of phosphor-logging so it can\u0027t call any lg2 API to disable prints (I wasn\u0027t thinking ahead when I suggested that). And it doesn\u0027t make sense to require the user to always set an environment variable to make the app work correctly.\n\nMaybe the answer here is that libraries should not use lg2?\n\nI just tested glog in a simple program and it does not print anything to stderr by default. It requires a flag or env var: https://github.com/google/glog?tab\u003dreadme-ov-file#setting-flags",

      "message": "Sorry, I was wrong. glog does print to stderr by default but only for ERROR messages. What do you think of implementing the same `stderrthreshold` environment variable in lg2 such that only errors and above are printed by default and an environment variable can modify the threshold?\n\nI think it would be a reasonable solution to my specific problem which is mostly clutter caused by debug and info messages.",
