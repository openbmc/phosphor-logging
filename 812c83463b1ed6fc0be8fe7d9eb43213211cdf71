      "message": "I need to think about one more thing here.\n\nI saw in the lab that if hostboot crashes they create a PEL with a 0x51 severity, but then the BMC sees that and just reboots and tries again. How this code is now, there would be a progress SRC because of that PEL, but no SRC on the panel because hostboot didn\u0027t set the terminate bit, and the IPL would keep going anyway.\n\nMaybe it would be better to be consistent and switch this severity check to check for the terminate bit instead...",

      "message": "Ok but then if hostboot is not setting the terminate bit (why?? does it need different condition(s) to set) we are setting it now based on 0x51 severity and SRC would be both on progress SRC and on panel. Isn\u0027t this ok? or is it that terminate bit cannot be set based on 0x51 severity? If yes then who can set and under what circumstances?",
