How this code is now, there would be a progress SRC because of that PEL, but no SRC on the panel because hostboot didn\u0027t set the terminate bit, and the IPL would keep going anyway.\n\nMaybe it would be better to be consistent and switch this severity check to check for the terminate bit instead...",
