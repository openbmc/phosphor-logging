      "message": "so sorry for missing this before, but these three calls are making 3 of the exact same GetSubTree calls.  I would like to avoid that so we make the minimum number of d-bus calls possible.  I think you could simplify the code to have \n\nstd::tuple\u003cbool, bool, bool\u003e DataInterface::getDumpStatus()\n\nand it hardcodes the dump types within the function and does one GetSubTree and returns the results, so you could do like:\n\nauto [hasBmcDump, hasHostbootDump, hasResourceDump] \u003d dataIface.getDumpStatus();",
