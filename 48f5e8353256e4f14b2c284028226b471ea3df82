      "message": "One other important reason for the existing journald code is that we\u0027re not writing the full string to the journal on every entry, which saves a significant amount of space.  I don\u0027t really see mention of how the backend of this is going to work, but we should make sure that we have an accounting for that so we don\u0027t lose the ability to store many records.",

I\u0027m not sure that hex encodings are supported in Redfish, so we should probably make sure that in the underlying data, we\u0027re writing as an int.",
