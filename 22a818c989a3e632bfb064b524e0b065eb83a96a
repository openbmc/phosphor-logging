      "message": "I agree in a header.  In a source file I think it can be up to the file owner to decide.\n\nAs you see here I just replaced the existing \u0027using namespace phosphor::logging\u0027 with the equivalent from lg2.  (lg2 is actually finer grained than phosphor::logging because it is explicit about what names are included.)  But, yes, \u0027error\u0027 is the main one that is potentially problematic.  When I was porting phosphor-virtual-sensors I had to change a few cases of \u0027error\u0027 being used as a variable name to avoid the ambiguity.\n\nIf you prefer these to all be \u0027lg2::error\u0027, \u0027lg2::info\u0027, etc. in this file I\u0027ll make it happen.",
