      "message": "The only reason additionaData is being passed in here is to check if the PID of the process that creates the PEL is passed in, but that will never be the case for PELs that come from hostboot.\n\nSo I think you don\u0027t need to pass additionalData all the way in from the top, instead you can just make it a local variable here, and it will be empty.  that will also saving from changing the other function signatures.\n\nWhile you\u0027re at it, I think it would be good to slighly tweak the addProcessNameToJSON function to not print \"Unknown\" if the PID isn\u0027t passed in, because there\u0027s really no reason that needs to show up in hostboot PELs at all.",
