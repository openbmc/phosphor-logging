      "message": "I would suggest we turn it into a template parameter so that existing code is unchanged. My reasons:\n\n1. Most current users don’t care about the return but you are making them block now where the code use to be fire-and-forget.  (Performance impact)\n2. This code is now not async which means that code owners who really want async behavior are even less likely to use phosphor-logging.\n\nMaybe I’m wrong and the dbus call always blocks even today though?",
