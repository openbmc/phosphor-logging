I don\u0027t think it really matters from a technical point of view, so it\u0027s fine for now, may need to revisit in the future if something comes up.\n\nThat \u0027bmc\u0027 segment also is maybe unnecessary since the one that proceeds it already mentions bmc.  I suppose that would be a pain to fix in the PLDM code though.",
