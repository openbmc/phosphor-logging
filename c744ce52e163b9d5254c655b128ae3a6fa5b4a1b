      "message": "This sounds a little confused; there\u0027s no dependency on pldm (the daemon process?) for either the old \"requester\" APIs or the new \"transport\" APIs. That said, the comment sounds like it\u0027s alluding to circumstances around the libpldm _instance ID_ APIs; prior to the libpldm instance ID APIs applications _did_ have to rely on the pldm daemon as it was managing the shared instance ID pool. That\u0027s no-longer the case, but again, that\u0027s independent of the transport API problem, but we need to solve both problems together to migrate applications to the in-kernel MCTP solution.",
