I think it would be much simpler and give us more formatting flexibility to use an existing formatter like fmtlib / std::format instead of inventing our own syntax that is vaguely likey a limited iostream. It seems like it would be perfectly acceptable to have format strings per entry() and then have the upper layer that allows emplacing their values in the format string.",

I addressed that in the following Qs, didn\u0027t I?\n\n\u003e It seems like it would be perfectly acceptable to have format strings per entry() and then have the upper layer that allows emplacing their values in the format string.\n\nMaybe.  I think I covered this by the paragraph in line 222 and 253.\n\nI think there is a fundamental disagreement with you on the ergonomics of the \u0027entry\u0027 syntax from before.  I\u0027ve heard from many people that they absolutely hated how verbose it was and some of them said that it was one of the primary reasons they avoided using phosphor-logging.  I don\u0027t know how to reconcile all the view-points here.",
