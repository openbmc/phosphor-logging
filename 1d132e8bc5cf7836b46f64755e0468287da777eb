      "message": "The metadata is being removed, i assume that\u0027s an acceptable tradeoff instead of duplicating the templated function that takes the elog entries? Maybe an update to the openpower-pels/README.md would be good to specify that the tracing is just via string and no metadata would be stored.",

      "message": "The only time I\u0027ve ever looked at metadata is just because it isn\u0027t in the main trace message, so yea, I think it\u0027s OK unless you can think of a problem with it.\n\nThe journal wouldn\u0027t be available to put metadata into on AIX if we built it there, so I think the more details in the message itself the better anyway, plus we don\u0027t have to reimplement log\u003c\u003e() without using libphosphor_logging since it\u0027s also wrapped up with commit\u003c\u003e(), report\u003c\u003e(), that uses sdbusplus.\n\nThis only applies to code that is used by peltool, I should specify that in the commit message.",
