# OpenPower Platform Event Log (PEL) extension

This extension will create PELs for every OpenBMC event log. It is also
possible to point to the raw PEL to use in the OpenBMC event, and then that
will be used instead of creating one.

## Passing PEL related data within an OpenBMC event log

An error log creator can pass in data that is relevant to a PEL by using
certain keywords in the AdditionalData property of the event log.

### AdditionalData keywords

#### RAWPEL

This keyword is used to point to an existing PEL in a binary file that should
be associated with this event log.  The syntax is:
```
RAWPEL=<path to PEL File>
e.g.
RAWPEL="/tmp/pels/pel.5"
```
The code will assign its own error log ID to this PEL, and also update the
commit timestamp field to the current time.

#### _PID

This keyword that contains the application's PID is added automatically by the
phosphor-logging daemon when the `commit` or `report` APIs are used to create
an event log, but not when the `Create` D-Bus method is used.  If a caller of
the `Create` API wishes to have their PID captured in the PEL this should be
used.

This will be added to the PEL in a section of type User Data (UD), along with
the application name it corresponds to.

The syntax is:
```
_PID=<PID of application>
e.g.
_PID="12345"
```

#### CALLOUT_INVENTORY_PATH

This is used to pass in an inventory item to use as a callout.  See [here for
details](#passing-callouts-in-with-the-additionaldata-property)

#### CALLOUT_DEVICE_PATH with CALLOUT_ERRNO

This is used to pass in a device path to create callouts from.  See [here for
details](#passing-callouts-in-with-the-additionaldata-property)

#### CALLOUT_IIC_BUS with CALLOUT_IIC_ADDR and CALLOUT_ERRNO

This is used to pass in an I2C bus and address to create callouts from.  See
[here for details](#passing-callouts-in-with-the-additionaldata-property)

## Default UserData sections for BMC created PELs

The extension code that creates PELs will add these UserData sections to every
PEL:

- The AdditionalData property contents
  - If the AdditionalData property in the OpenBMC event log has anything in it,
    it will be saved in a UserData section as a JSON string.

## The PEL Message Registry

The PEL message registry is used to create PELs from OpenBMC event logs.
Documentation can be found [here](registry/README.md).

## Callouts

A callout points to a FRU, a symbolic FRU, or an isolation procedure.  There
can be from zero to ten of them in each PEL, where they are located in the SRC
section.

There are a few different ways to add callouts to a PEL:

### Passing callouts in with the AdditionalData property

The PEL code can add callouts based on the values of special entries in the
AdditionalData event log property.  They are:

- CALLOUT_INVENTORY_PATH

    This keyword is used to call out a single FRU by passing in its D-Bus
    inventory path.  When the PEL code sees this, it will create a single high
    priority FRU callout, using the VPD properties (location code, FN, CCIN)
    from that inventory item.  If that item is not a FRU itself and does not
    have a location code, it will keep searching its parents until it finds one
    that is.

    ```
    CALLOUT_INVENTORY_PATH=
    "/xyz/openbmc_project/inventory/system/chassis/motherboard"
    ```

- CALLOUT_DEVICE_PATH with CALLOUT_ERRNO

    These keywords are required as a pair to indicate faulty device
    communication, usually detected by a failure accessing a device at that
    sysfs path.  The PEL code will use a data table generated by the MRW to map
    these device paths to FRU callout lists.  The errno value may influence the
    callout.

    TBD: Which exact types of device paths are supported.

    ```
    CALLOUT_DEVICE_PATH="/sys/bus/i2c/devices/3-0069"
    CALLOUT_ERRNO="2"
    ```

- CALLOUT_IIC_BUS with CALLOUT_IIC_ADDR and CALLOUT_ERRNO

    These 3 keywords can be used to callout a failing I2C device path when the
    full device path isn't known.  It is similar to CALLOUT_DEVICE_PATH in that
    it will use data tables generated by the MRW to create the callouts.

    CALLOUT_IIC_BUS is in the form "/dev/i2c-X" where X is the bus number.
    CALLOUT_IIC_ADDR is the 7 bit address either as a decimal or a hex number
    if preceded with a "0x".

    ```
    CALLOUT_IIC_BUS="/dev/i2c-7"
    CALLOUT_IIC_ADDR="81"
    CALLOUT_ERRNO=62
    ```

### Defining callouts in the message registry

Callouts can be completely defined inside that error's definition in the PEL
message registry.  This method allows the callouts to vary based on the system
type or on any AdditionalData item.

At a high level, this involves defining a callout section inside the registry
entry that contain the location codes or procedure names to use, along with
their priority.  If these can vary based on system type, the type provided by
the entity manager will be one of the keys.  If they can also depend on an
AdditionalData entry, then that will also be a key.

See the message registry [README](registry/README.md) and
[schema](registry/schema/schema.json) for the details.

### Using the message registry along with CALLOUT_ entries

If the message registry entry contains a callout definition and the event log
also contains one of aforementioned CALLOUT keys in the AdditionalData
property, then the PEL code will first add the callouts stemming from the
CALLOUT items, followed by the callouts from the message registry.

### Using external callout tables

Some applications, such as the code from the openpower-hw-diags repository,
have their own callout tables that contain the callouts to use for the errors
they generate.

**TODO**:  The best way to pass these callouts in to the PEL creation code.

## `Action Flags` and `Event Type` Rules

The `Action Flags` and `Event Type` PEL fields are optional in the message
registry, and if not present the code will set them based on certain rules
layed out in the PEL spec.  In fact, even if they were specified, the checks
are still done to ensure consistency across all the logs.

These rules are:
1. Always set the `Report` flag, unless the `Do Not Report` flag is already on.
2. Always clear the `SP Call Home` flag, as that feature isn't supported.
3. If the severity is `Non-error Event`:
    - Clear the `Service Action` flag.
    - Clear the `Call Home` flag.
    - If the `Event Type` field is `Not Applicable`, change it to `Information
      Only`.
    - If the `Event Type` field is `Information Only` or `Tracing`, set the
      `Hidden` flag.
4. If the severity is `Recovered`:
    - Set the `Hidden` flag.
    - Clear the `Service Action` flag.
    - Clear the `Call Home` flag.
5. For all other severities:
    - Clear the `Hidden` flag.
    - Set the `Service Action` flag.
    - Set the `Call Home` flag.

Additional rules may be added in the future if necessary.
