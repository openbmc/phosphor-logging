If you were creating these in a common upstream repository, you\u0027d probably need to move to use the new event YAML that was recently introduced instead of manually calling Logging.Create.  And I suppose there\u0027s still a chance someone could come in here and change all of these.\n\nAlso, the new event yaml doesn\u0027t have .Error. segment at all so removing it here is fine.",
