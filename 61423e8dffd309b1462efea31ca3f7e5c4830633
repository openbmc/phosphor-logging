      "message": "I think it would be useful to store the value even if it is wrong, since it would be good for debug.  Something like the following maybe:\n\nstd::string value{\"0x\"};\nstd::for_each(keyword.begin(), keyword.end(), [] (const auto\u0026 byte)\n{\n   value +\u003d fmt::format(\"{0x:}\", byte);\n})\n\n\nAll the format documentation is at https://fmt.dev/latest/syntax.html.  Not sure if the {0x:} on a value of 0 would convert to a \"0\" or \"00\", but there\u0027s hopefully a way to specify a width.  Could also maybe just use the getNumberString() function used elsewhere in this file if fmt::format won\u0027t work right.",
